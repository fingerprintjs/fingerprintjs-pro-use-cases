/**
 * Cloudflare rule expressions are limited to [4096 characters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/#maximum-rule-expression-length).
 * IPv6 maximum length is [45 characters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/166132/maximum-length-of-the-textual-representation-of-an-ipv6-address) plus quotes and a space is 48.
 * "http.x_forwarded_for in {}" is 26 characters.
 * (4096 - 26) / 48 = 84
 * You can block 84 IP addresses in a single Cloudflare custom rule.
 * 5 custom rules on a free Cloudflare plan gets you 420 IP addresses you can block at any given time.
 * That is sufficient for the purposes of this demonstration.
 * If you need to, you can squeeze in more IPs by testing their actual length and also using a higher Cloudflare plan with more custom rules.
 * This strategy is applicable to any web application firewall solution configurable using an API. The limitations will vary depending on your cloud provider.

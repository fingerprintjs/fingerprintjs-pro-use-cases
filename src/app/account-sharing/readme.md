# Account Sharing Prevention

In this use case demo, we use Fingerprint Identification (https://fingerprint.com/products/identification/) to detect when multiple devices are using the same account.

- The core of the use case is implemented in the [Account sharing component](./AccountSharing.tsx) and the [login endpoint](./api/login/route.ts).
